# My OpenGL
This is a basic self-made template. Help guides to remove coder's block include:
  * [InitGL](https://github.com/aaronmjacobs/InitGL)
  * [Glitter](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter)
  * [Open.gl](https://open.gl/)

I have used `cmake` and `git submodule`, so be sure to use those.

Please provide images `A.jpg` and `B.jpg` in the `assets` folder.
